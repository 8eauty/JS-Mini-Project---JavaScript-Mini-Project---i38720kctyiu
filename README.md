A calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom.
In my calculator i have made 16 buttons for multiple operations such as plus sign(+) for addition, multiply sign(*) for multiplication, minus sign(-) for subtraction, divide sign(/) for division, modulus sign(%) for modulus operation.
